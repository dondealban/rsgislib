# rsgislib
This repository contains modified Python scripts that utilise the Remote Sensing and GIS software library (RSGISLib) for processing JAXA's SAR mosaic image datasets. These are based on the original scripts developed by Dr Peter Bunting (Aberystwyth University) and Dr Daniel Clewley (University of Southern California) for the Global Magrove Watch Workshop during the 20th Science Team Meeting of the Kyoto & Carbon Initiative on December 2013 held in Tokyo, Japan.
